# Project Nimbus

This is a full stack app that gets wether information based on a user's location and displays as per the user's set preferences. I am creating this app to lean how to make implement server backend code and user authentication.

## Cloud Database

I am using Mongodb as the database that stores user credentials. Right now it stores username, password, and location.

## Development Environment

The backend is built with node.js and the front end is build with static html and javascript.

## Future Work

Things that still need to be done:

- Implement user sign up
- Implement a salt and hash algorithm for storing sensitive user credentials
- Increase the amount of preferences that can be stored in the database, For example: background image, color scheme, temperature unit, ect.
